Welcome! This repository contains the MERN stack project I developed during my internship as part of learning modern web development. Throughout the internship, I focused on mastering the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js—by building this full-stack application from scratch. This project showcases my practical understanding and hands-on experience with the technologies.
